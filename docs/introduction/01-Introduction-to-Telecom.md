# Introduction to Telecom

## Communication basics

- Communication is a process of transfer of information from Sender to Receiver over a communication medium
- Communication medium
    - Verbal communication
    - Written communication
    - Electronics and Digital communication
    - Visual communication
    - Print media
    - Broadcast media
    - Gestures and body language

## Communication systems

A communication system conveys information from its source to a destination.

## Capacity of a channel

The most important question for a communication channel is the maximum rate at which it can transfer information. 
There is a theoretical maximum rate at which information passes error free over the channel, called the channel capacity C. 
The famous Hartley-Shannon Law states that the channel capacity C is given by: 

`C=B*log(1+(S/N))`

Where, 
 - B is the bandwidth, 
 - S/N is the signal-to-noise ratio.


## What is telecommunications?

Telecommunications is the transmission of information over a distance. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, from simple telephone networks to complex fiber optic networks. 


## What are the changes that telecommunications engineering tries to solve?

General challenges in telecommunications engineering include:

- Performance
- Reliability
- Affordability 

Some specific challenges are
- Increasing the capacity of telecommunications networks to handle more data traffic
- Reducing the latency of telecommunications networks to improve the responsiveness of applications
- Expanding the coverage of telecommunications networks to reach more people and places
- Making telecommunications networks more secure and resilient to attacks
- Reducing the cost of telecommunications services to make them more affordable for everyone
